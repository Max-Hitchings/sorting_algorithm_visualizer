Learning how to use react js

Made from scratch by me using react and some material ui components

## bubble sort

Bubble sort works by iteratively stepping through a list comparing the current item against the next item and swaping them if the next item is smaller. This is repeated until the list is sorted.

## selection sort

Selection sort works by dividing the array into two parts, a sorted and unsorted part. The sorted part starts off empty. It then finds the smallest item in the unsorted array and adds it to the end of the sorted list. This repeats until the array is solved.

## insertion sort
